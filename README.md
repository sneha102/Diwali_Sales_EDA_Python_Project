# Diwali Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This Python-powered analytics project dives deep into Diwali Sales Data using Jupyter Notebook to reveal powerful, actionable insights. From decoding customer behavior and buying patterns to spotlighting top-performing products and regional sales trends, this project turns raw data into festive business intelligence — perfect for marketers, retailers, and analysts looking to make data-driven decisions during India’s biggest shopping season.

## Built With
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy - Data manipulation and cleaning
- Matplotlib, Seaborn - Visualization
- Jupyter Notebook - Interactive analysis environment

## Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis on Diwali Sales Data to :

- Clean and preprocess data
- Understand customer demographics (gender, age group, maritial status, occupation)
- Identify key sales trends by product category, geography, and customer segment
- Provide insights for better inventory planning and marketing strategy

## Usage
1. Clone or Download this repository
2. Install Dependencies:
    ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open ```Diwali_EDA.ipynb``` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially

## Analysis Workflow
- **Data Loading :** Load and inspect the dataset
- **Data Cleaning :** Drop irrelevant columns, handle missing values, correct types
- **Exploratory Analysis :**
  1. Gender and Amount distribution
  2. Age group segmentation
  3. State-wise orders and sales
  4. Occupation and product category trends
- **Visualizations :** Bar charts, Countplot, Annotations
- **Key KPIs :** Top states by sales & orders, highest buying segments, revenue by product

## Key Takeaways
- Females dominate in both count and revenue
- Age group 26–35 drives maximum sales
- States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka contribute most orders and revenue
- Married women from IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors prefer Food, Clothing, Electronics categories

## Future Enhancements
- Predictive modeling (eg. sales forecasting)
- Automated data pipelines for real-time monitoring
- Enhanced visuals, dashboards or dashboards integration (Streamlit, Power BI)
